            A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of
            servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by
            reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. This
            helps users around the world view the same high-quality content
            without slow loading times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single
            end user request. This results in significant traffic to the origin
            and subsequent load, thereby increasing the chances for origin
            failure if the traffic spikes are exceedingly high or if the load is
            persistent.
          </p>
          <p>
            By responding to end user requests in place of the origin and in
            closer physical and network proximity to the end user, a CDN
            offloads traffic from content servers and improves the web
            experience, thus benefiting both the content provider and its end
            users. How does a CDN work? Over half of the internet’s traffic is
            served by a content delivery network (CDN). The goal of the CDN is
            to reduce latency – the delay between submitting a request for a web
            page and the web page fully loading on your device – by reducing the
            physical distance that the request has to travel. For example, a US
            visitor wishing to view content which originates at a UK-based
            server will experience poor loading times if this request has to
            travel across the Atlantic. To combat this, CDNs store a cached
            version of your website content in multiple geographical locations
            around the world, which are known as “points of presence” (PoPs).
            These PoPs will contain their own caching servers and will be
            responsible for delivering that content in the user’s location.
            User-agents, which are essentially devices running web browsers,
            make requests for content needed to render web pages such as HTML,
            images, CSS, and JavaScript files. For most CDNs, each request for
            content will cause the end user to be mapped to an optimally-located
            CDN server and the server will respond with the cached (pre-saved)
            version of the requested files. If it fails to locate the files, it
            will look for the content on the other servers in the CDN platform
            and send the response to the end user. However, when content is
            unavailable or stale, the CDN will act as a request proxy to the
            origin server and store the fetched content to serve future
            requests. Although the delivery of website content is a common use
            case for CDNs, it is not the only type of content that a CDN can
            deliver. In fact, CDNs deliver an incredible variety of content that
            includes: 4K and HD-quality video; audio streams; software downloads
            such as apps, games, and OS updates; data records that contain
            medical and financial information; and much more. Potentially any
            data that can be digitized can be delivered through a CDN. Akamai
            What is a CDN? Video ???Watch the Video??? What is a CDN provider? A
            CDN provider is a vendor that provides businesses the ability to
            serve their content to end users across the world over a content
            delivery network. At Akamai, we take pride in being the world’s
            leading CDN provider. Why use a CDN? CDNs offer an easy way to
            increase the speed of a website while also lowering the latency.
            Therefore, they are essential for the fast, efficient and secure
            delivery of content to users around the world. This content is not
            simply limited to website content alone; it can also comprise 4K and
            HD-quality video, audio streams, apps, games and OS updates. With
            website visitor attention spans growing shorter by the day, it is
            imperative to deliver this content as quickly as possible. As more
            businesses go online, and the world comes together on the Internet
            to shop, connect, and share, content providers face an increasing
            array of challenges such as: delivery of different types of content,
            adjusting content for different device types (device detection), and
            securing data and the online presence of their end users. The
            inherent capabilities of a content delivery network mean that CDN
            providers are uniquely positioned to help businesses overcome these
            diverse challenges of media delivery. For almost 20 years, CDNs have
            formed the unseen backbone of the Internet delivering online content
            for retail, finance, healthcare, and other businesses to end users
            around the world with speed and at scale. If you’ve done almost
            anything online, you’ve benefited from a CDN – whether you knew it
            or not. We hope you enjoyed this article. For more information,
